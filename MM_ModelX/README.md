# MM_ModelX - Virtual Analog Hybrid Synth for VCV Rack
A crossover between two famous synthesizers

![Alt text](./screenshot.png)

This plugin is a cross between two famous synthesizers, one from the 70's and one from the 80's.<br>
It brings together the Maug oscillators, the CZ oscillators, the Filtah and other Mockba Modular components to create a full featured 3-Oscillator synthesizer.

This plugin has a few advantages over the original, being polyphony one of the most interesting. Which makes it capable of very rich pad and strings sounds.
