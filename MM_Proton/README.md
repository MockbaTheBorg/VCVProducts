# MM_Proton - Virtual Analog Synth for VCV Rack
Custom VA synth for VCV Rack

![Alt text](./screenshot.png)

This plugin implements new anti-aliased oscillators, with different waveforms and a few features like variable PWM and phase inversion.
The filter is also upgraded to have Low-Pass, High-Pass and Band-Pass modes.

This new set of oscillators allows for a completely different set of sounds than the other two plugins of the same series.
