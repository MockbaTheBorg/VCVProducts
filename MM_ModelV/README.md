# MM_ModelV - Virtual Analog Synth for VCV Rack
A tribute to a famous synthesizer from the 70's

![Alt text](./screenshot.png)

This plugin is a virtual tribute to one famous synthesizer from the 70's, yes, that one that just came to your mind.<br>
It brings together the Maug oscillators, the Filtah and other Mockba Modular components to create a full featured 3-Oscillator synthesizer.

This plugin has a few advantages over the original, being polyphony one of them most interesting. Which makes it capable of very rich pad and strings sounds.
